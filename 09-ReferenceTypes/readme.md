### Reference Variables

- What are Reference Variables?
- How are they stored in memory?
- How are they initialized?
- How does assignement and equality work with Reference Variables

```
Animal dog = new Animal();
```

The instance of new Animal - Animal object - is created in memory. The memory address of the object created is stored in the dog reference variable.

Reference Variables contains a reference or a guide to get to the actual object in memory.
